This is the first paragraph of an example document. It's mostly here as
placeholder text with a bit more grammar and coherence than a big pile
of lorem ipsum. Something that could be used to easily anchor one's
attention on a piece of text when looking at a diff. We don't want to
get confused when merging and rebasing!

This is a new paragraph that will cause a merge conflict after the first
alter_text branch has been merged.
